Intitial tests for alternatives for building large wilderness areas in Evennia. 

These files are just from the Evennia "world" folder. Unsure if this would still work, this was done early 2023.

Most needed improvements is not hardcoding any data, such as image_location and the room names/descriptions. Room data should be moved out to it's own file, and would want to create command to enable user to define this at creation.

Was playing around with creating the image files from topographic data. Cannot remember the website I was using for the data, but then used some filters in GIMP to reduce it down to the colors I wanted.
